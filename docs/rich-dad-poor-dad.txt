Rich Dad Poor Dad - Book Summary
Rich Dad Poor Dad, published in 1997 by authors Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, has sold over 32 million copies in more than 51 languages. The book, which was endorsed by celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, stayed on the New York Times best-sellers list for six years. This summary highlights six rules that the authors believe can help you make your money work for you.

The author, Robert Kiyosaki, had two dads: his biological "Poor Dad" and his friend Mike's "Rich Dad". Kiyosaki's Poor Dad worked hard his whole life, was highly educated, but had a different philosophy on money than his Rich Dad. The Rich Dad, who didn't have as many degrees, made much more money.

Rule 1: The rich do not work for money
The key takeaway of this rule is that the poor work for money, while the rich have money work for them. Most people work for a monthly salary, but the fear of losing that job and source of income can trap them in a cycle of working hard just to pay bills. This "rat race" is fueled by fear and greedâ€”the fear of not having enough money and the greed to buy more things.

A job is a short-term solution to a long-term problem. The only way to get out of the fear-greed trap is to choose your thoughts and be in control of your emotions rather than just reacting to them. The author and his friend Mike started a comic-book lending library that generated money even when they weren't physically present, which demonstrates the idea of having money work for you.

Rule 2: Financial literacy is necessary
Kiyosaki and his friend Mike both became financially successful thanks to the financial literacy lessons taught by Mike's dad. The main rule of financial literacy is to understand the difference between an asset and a liability. An asset puts money in your pocket, while a liability takes money out.

Many people think their house is an asset, but it's actually a liability, especially if it's bought with a 20- to 30-year mortgage. While a house may offer tax breaks, it also comes with additional expenses. The rich buy assets, the poor have expenses, and the middle class buys liabilities they think are assets. Instead of spending a salary hike on a bigger house, invest it in assets that generate income.

Rule 3: Mind your own business
This rule emphasizes the difference between your 

profession and your business. The founder of McDonald's, Ray Kroc, saw his profession as selling hamburger franchises but considered his business to be real estate, which was the primary success factor for his restaurants.

A professional is "minding" someone else's business and works for a salary. A business person, on the other hand, uses their income to buy revenue-generating assets. These assets can include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and real estate that produce net positive income.

Rule 4: Use the cover of a corporation
This rule focuses on how the rich and poor handle taxes differently. People with jobs are taxed before their salary even reaches their bank account. Those who mind their own business have tax benefits. When you have a job, you earn, pay taxes, and then spend what's left. When you have a business, you earn, spend, and then pay taxes.

To manage taxes, it's important to build your financial IQ, which includes four key areas:

Understanding the basics of accounting so you can read financial statements.

Understanding the science of making money and investing.

Understanding the demand and supply aspects of the financial markets.

Understanding the law, especially regarding how it treats income from an individual versus a corporation.

Rule 5: The rich invent money
According to Kiyosaki's Rich Dad, money is not real; it's an idea. Wealth today comes from information, not land. The key to creating wealth is to train your mind to identify opportunities. A well-trained mind will be willing to take risks and invest in opportunities that others don't see.

The story of Alexander Graham Bell is used to illustrate this point. When Bell tried to sell his telephone patent to the biggest company at the time, Western Union, they refused. Bell went on to create a billion-dollar industry with his own company, AT&T. This shows how a "brave hero" inside can overcome rejection and create massive wealth.

Rule 6: Work to learn
Instead of working hard for a salary, you should work to learn. A business consultant once told Kiyosaki that people are "one skill away from great wealth," meaning that mastering an additional skill can significantly increase your income. While his Poor Dad encouraged him to specialize, his Rich Dad told him to "know a little about a lot".

Management of cash flow, time, and people are key skills for success, along with communication and the ability to sell. Education is a more valuable long-term investment than money.

Why the financially literate still struggle
Even with financial knowledge, some people struggle to build assets because of:

Fear of losing money: This fear can lead to playing it safe and missing opportunities to build assets. The author suggests that failure should inspire you to win, not make you run to "safe shores".

Deep-rooted cynicism: An "inner critic" can create a "doomsday scenario" for every plan, which can prevent you from acting on opportunities to buy good assets.

Laziness: Laziness is often a way of avoiding things you'd rather not face. The author suggests that a little bit of greed can help you overcome laziness and ask for more.

Bad habits: A bad habit is paying bills first, which prioritizes others over yourself. Instead, prioritize yourself by not letting bill collectors and landlords push you around.

Arrogance: This is a combination of ego and ignorance. The solution is to educate yourself instead of trying to cover up your ignorance.

Take action now
To make your money work for you, you must take action. Look for new ideas and teachers who can help you learn. When the stock market crashes, don't run for cover; instead, start buying. Building a strong financial IQ will help you move away from general ideas like "work hard" and toward leveraging insights to build wealth. Action always beats inaction.
