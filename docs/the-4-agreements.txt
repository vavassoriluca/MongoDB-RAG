The Four Agreements: A Toltec Wisdom Book
The Big Ideas
The book, written by Don Miguel Ruiz, introduces four agreements based on ancient Toltec wisdom to help people achieve personal freedom and transcend social conditioning. The author asserts that living by these agreements can transform your life from a "dream of hell" into a personal "dream of heaven".

The four agreements are:

Be impeccable with your word.


Don't take anything personally.


Don't make assumptions.


Always do your best.


The Domestication of Humans
Ruiz argues that humans are domesticated in the same way animals are, through a system of punishment and reward. Children are called a "good boy" or "good girl" when they do what their parents want, and a "bad boy" or "bad girl" when they don't. This process leads to living in a "dream of hell" and a fear of being who we really are. To become free, we must break this domestication, which is a slow, step-by-step process requiring patience.


1st Agreement: Be Impeccable with Your Word
This is the most important and difficult agreement to honor. Impeccable comes from the Latin word 

pecatus meaning 'sin', and the prefix im- meaning 'without'. Therefore, impeccable means "without sin". A sin is anything you do that goes against yourself, such as judging or blaming yourself. To be impeccable with your word means to not use your word against yourself or others. This includes avoiding gossip, criticism, and blaming. It also means honoring your commitments and only making commitments you intend to keep.





2nd Agreement: Don't Take Anything Personally
This agreement states that whatever happens around you, you should not take it personally. What others say and do is a reflection of their own reality, not of you. The way people treat you has nothing to do with you; it has to do with them. If someone calls you stupid, it's not about you, it's about them. This agreement helps you avoid anger, jealousy, envy, and sadness.





3rd Agreement: Don't Make Assumptions
We tend to make assumptions about everything, and the problem is that we believe they are the truth. This leads to misunderstandings, taking things personally, blaming others, and creating a lot of unnecessary drama. The way to avoid making assumptions is to have the courage to ask questions and make sure communication is clear.


4th Agreement: Always Do Your Best
This agreement is the one that allows the other three to become ingrained habits. The idea is to always do your best under any circumstance, no more and no less. Your best will never be the same from one moment to the next because everything is constantly changing. The goal is to close the gap between what you're doing and what you're capable of doing, which can prevent feelings of anxiety and disillusionment. The concept of 




Aret√©, a Greek ideal, means "striving to do your best moment to moment". Consistent effort leads to improvement, which is known as 

kaizen in Japanese culture, meaning "continual improvement".

We Stop Ourselves
The author states that we stop ourselves from being free by blaming others, such as the government, our parents, or God. This is a reminder that the only person to blame for our shortcomings is ourselves.


Repetition Makes the Master
The old, fear-based agreements that rule our lives are the result of repeating them over and over again. To adopt the four new agreements, you must put 


repetition into action. The new agreements become deeply ingrained habits by practicing them over and over again. As Aristotle said, "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit".
