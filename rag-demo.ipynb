This summary highlights six rules that the authors believe can help you make your money work for you.\\n\\nThe author, Robert Kiyosaki, had two dads: his biological \\\"Poor Dad\\\" and his friend Mike's \\\"Rich Dad\\\". Kiyosaki's Poor Dad worked hard his whole life, was highly educated, but had a different philosophy on money than his Rich Dad.

Most people work for a monthly salary, but the fear of losing that job and source of income can trap them in a cycle of working hard just to pay bills. This \\\"rat race\\\" is \"\n",
